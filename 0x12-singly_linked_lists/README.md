This is the first approach to singly linked lists. We will see how to handle, in a basic way, the nodes of a list. A short description of each script:
+ 0-print_list.c: A function that prints all the elements of a list_t list. This function return the number of nodes in the list_t list.
+ 1-list_len.c: A function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.
+ 2-add_node.c: A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.
